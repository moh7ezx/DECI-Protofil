  <h1>My DECI Learnings</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h1>Topics I enjoyed the most</h1>
    <p>
      The topics I enjoyed the most during the DECI program were those related to problem-solving 
      and creativity. I found it exciting to use tools like Blockly and Thunkable to build small 
      applications that could respond to user input. It felt like I was bringing ideas to life. 
      I also enjoyed working on collaborative projects, especially when we had to combine coding, 
      design, and logical thinking together. The process of creating a portfolio was rewarding 
      because it allowed me to see how much progress I had made. It gave me confidence in my 
      ability to use technology to express my thoughts and creativity.

    <h1>Topics I want to learn more about</h1>
    <p>
      I want to learn more about cybersecurity because it is one of the most important fields 
      in the modern digital world. Knowing how to protect data and systems is not just useful 
      for companies, but also for individuals. I am also very curious about data science. The 
      idea of analyzing large amounts of information and finding hidden patterns fascinates me. 
      I believe that exploring data science will give me opportunities to solve real-world 
      problems in smart and innovative ways. Another topic I want to explore more is artificial 
      intelligence and how it can change the future of computing.

    <h1>Topics I thought were difficult</h1>
    <p>
      The topics I thought were difficult included understanding binary numbers and how computers 
      actually represent information at the lowest level. At first, it was challenging to think 
      in terms of 0s and 1s, but with practice, I started to see how important this foundation is. 
      I also found some programming concepts tricky, like loops and conditionals, especially when 
      combining them together to solve problems. However, these difficulties motivated me to keep 
      practicing, and eventually I could see my skills improving. Struggling with these concepts 
      showed me that learning is not always easy, but it is always rewarding.
